# Code Review

## Design Critique

The project's implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture effectively delineates
responsibilities across the model, view, controller, and imageio packages,
showcasing a commendable effort in maintaining separation of concerns. This structural choice not
only promotes modularity but also facilitates easier maintenance and future scalability.
However, the design slightly falters as the model oversteps its bounds by handling both reading and
writing images, tasks that conventionally align more with the controller's responsibilities.
This muddling of roles can lead to challenges in maintainability and clarity.

## Implementation Critique

In implementation, the use of split commands ("<command-name>-split") deviates from the streamlined
approach of handling operations with a single command.
This bifurcation leads to redundancy and potentially complicates future code modifications. The GUI,
while functional, lacks intuitiveness in error feedback and requires
window resizing for complete functionality visibility, negatively impacting user experience.

## Documentation Critique

The project benefits from extensive documentation, as evidenced by the presence of comprehensive
README and user guides. This is a strong point, indicative of a commitment to
making the software understandable and usable. However, the effectiveness of the documentation is
somewhat hampered by its lack of detail and clarity in certain areas.

## Strengths, Limitations, and Suggestions

### Strengths

Modularity and Design Patterns: The modular approach and adherence to design patterns like MVC and
Command are commendable. They contribute to a cleaner, more manageable codebase,
particularly advantageous for applications with complex business logic.

Documentation: The availability of extensive documentation supports user understanding and future
maintenance.

### Limitations

Design Overreach: The model's involvement in image I/O operations is a design overreach that could
be streamlined.

Implementation Redundancy: The use of separate split commands introduces unnecessary complexity.

GUI Usability: The current GUI design lacks optimal user interaction and error feedback.

## Suggestions

Realign Responsibilities: Consider shifting image I/O operations from the model to the controller to
adhere more closely to MVC principles.

Consolidate Commands: Explore the introduction of an adapter or factory pattern to streamline
command handling.

Enhance GUI Design: Improve the GUI by incorporating visual error feedback and ensuring all
functionalities are accessible without window resizing.

Refine Documentation: Further detail and clarity in documentation, including more examples and
troubleshooting guides, would enhance its effectiveness.

Adhere to Java Best Practices: Regularly review code quality, particularly addressing warnings
flagged by linters, and maintain adherence to best practices in coding and documentation.

In summary, while the project shows a robust foundation in design and documentation, it can benefit
significantly from refinements in implementation strategies, GUI design, and further
polishing of its documentation. Addressing these aspects will substantially enhance the software's
usability and maintainability.
